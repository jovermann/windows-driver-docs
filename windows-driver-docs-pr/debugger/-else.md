# .else

```
.if (Condition) { Commands } .else { Commands } 

.if (Condition) { Commands } .elsif (Condition) { Commands } .else { Commands } 
```

<span id="_______Commands______"></span><span id="_______commands______"></span><span id="_______COMMANDS______"></span> *Commands*   
Specifies one or more commands that will be executed conditionally. This block of commands needs to be enclosed in braces, even if it consists of a single command. Multiple commands should be separated by semicolons, but the final command before the closing brace does not need to be followed by a semicolon.
